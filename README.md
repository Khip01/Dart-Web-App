# gh-pages

### WHERE did these files come from?
These files come from the results of deploying the dart web app project into several files that can be executed by the website. 

<br>

## Steps 
- Go to the dart web app project directory ```cd Dart-Web-App```
- Run the ``peanut`` command _(more details in the [peanut dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/peanut))_
- Voila, and it will automatically create a new gh-pages branch. And we just push the gh-pages branch to github repo.
